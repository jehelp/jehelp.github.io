I am an Associate Professor at [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en) affiliated at:
- [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en) where I teach and manage programs in the field of Civil and Environmental Engineering
- [Laboratoire de Mécanique Paris-Saclay](https://) where I develop my research in computational mechanics and stochastic structural reliability.

At CentraleSupélec, I serve as:
- teacher in several courses (see [teaching](https://jehelp.github.io/teaching/))
- co-head of the [graduate program in Civil and Urban Engineering](https://mention-sic.blogspot.fr/p/presentation.html)
- co-head of the [*CityFaberLab* students projects hub](https://cityfaberlab.blogspot.com/).

In the *Laboratoire de Mécanique Paris-Saclay* I am currently active in three research projects for adapting transportation infrastructures to climate change, aging, and dense urban areas (see [research](https://jehelp.github.io/research/)).
