### MINERVE project

MINERVE is a public-private $40 million-project gathering 4 industrial partners (SNCF, RATP, Colas Rail, Kayrros), 1 institutional partner (IREX) and Université Paris-Saclay | CentraleSupélec as the academic partner. \
The project aims at reaching the carbone net-zero objective in the rail infrastructure sector while adapting the rail infrastructure to climate change. Collaboration and digital continuity all over the life-cycle of the French rail infrastructure will be developed. As Principal Investigator for Université Paris-Saclay | CentraleSupélec, I am in charge of coordinating 2 tasks of the project and of carrying out research to i) develop algorithms and predictive numerical models to assess rail assets performance in the uncertain context of climate change, and ii) to develop a common data environment platform in a multi-disciplinary team of 10 researchers. \
The MINERVE project is financially supported by the French government in the framework of its 4th “investing for the future” program. \

### GEOPONT project

GEOPONT gathers the expertise of 2 industrial partners (Bouygues Construction and SpotLight Earth) and Université Paris-Saclay | CentraleSupélec to develop a methodology for the fast and affordable health monitoring of reinforced concrete bridges. Established and emerging geophysical methods are considered. As Principal Investigator and with a post-doctoral researcher under my supervision, I am in charge of i) designing simulation-informed active seismic surveys for collecting data on bridges and ii) developing field-experiment-informed numerical simulations of active seismic surveys to detect possible damage in a bridge.
