### MINERVE project

MINERVE is a public-private $40 million-project gathering 4 industrial partners (SNCF, RATP, Colas Rail, Kayrros), 1 institutional partner (IREX) and Université Paris-Saclay | CentraleSupélec as the academic partner. The project aims at reaching the carbone net-zero objective in the rail infrastructure sector while adapting the rail infrastructure to climate change. Collaboration and digital continuity all over the life-cycle of the French rail infrastructure will be developed. As Principal Investigator for Université Paris-Saclay | CentraleSupélec, I am in charge of coordinating a team of 12 researchers and of carrying out research to i) develop algorithms and predictive numerical models to assess rail assets performance in the uncertain context of climate change, and ii) to develop a common data environment platform.
It is financially supported by the French government in the framework of its 4th “investing for the future” program.
