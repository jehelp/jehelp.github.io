I am an Associate Professor at [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en) affiliated at:
* [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en) where I teach and manage programs in the field of Civil and Environmental Engineering
* [Laboratoire de Mécanique Paris-Saclay](https://) where I develop my research mostly in computational mechanics and stochastic structural reliability.

At CentraleSupélec, I am teaching several courses (see [teaching](https://jehelp.github.io/teaching/)) and I serve as:
* co-head of the [graduate program in Civil and Urban Engineering](https://mention-sic.blogspot.fr/p/presentation.html)
* co-head of the [*CityFaberLab* student projects hub](https://cityfaberlab.blogspot.com/).

With the *Laboratoire de Mécanique Paris-Saclay* I am currently active in three research projects for adapting transportation infrastructures to climate change, aging, and dense urban areas (see [research](https://jehelp.github.io/research/)).

I am a Civil Engineer and I hold a PhD from *École normale supérieure Paris-Saclay*. I started an academic career in 2010 as an Assistant Professor. From 2012 to 2015, I developed my research in the Department of Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics at Columbia University with a Marie-Sklodowska Curie Fellowship from the European Commission. I have had the chance to work and live in three countries: France, Canada, and the United States.

Beside my career in the Academia, I love watching movies (especially Italian movies from the 50's and 60's), listening to classical music (I very much like the music of Robert Schumann), browsing among cities, taking care of trees, hiking in the mountains (which reminds me my childhood).
